## 📜 Differences
NXP is currently in alpha stage, but it's going to be almost identical to NPM, except for a couple changes.

| Feature               | State          |
| -                     | -              |
| safe file overwriting | ✅ implemented |
| custom package files  | 💡 idea        |

`implemented` means it's already visible while using NXP, <br>
`idea` means there's no code for it yet as I'm not sure whether to do it
